      <description>If you want to develop on ESP32 boards with ESP-IDF there are now several applications you can use as an IDE or editor. In late 2018 I tried several of these options and here are the results so far. Surprisingly Visual Studio Code is overrepresented in this list, I was not aware of this editor up to now but arguably it is quite good.
Language Server Protocol VSCode also introduced some new nomenclature in the editor world, notably the Language Server Protocol.</description>

      <description>It would be quite easy to get temperature and humidity data into a graph with some Arduino code , an ESP32 and something like Thingspeak. However where&amp;rsquo;s the fun in that ? In this project I&amp;rsquo;ll be using the ESP-IDF framework for the ESP32, C on linux to write a proxy for InfluxDB and Grafana to create some graphs.
&amp;hellip;at least, that&amp;rsquo;s what I thought about a year ago. Let me explain, in 2016 i did the arduino bit as described above and created the following gas and weather graphs in a few weeks:</description>
